These are the fist Versions of my SPX/Music Managers.
If you are looking to understand this script, the SFXManager.sc file has exsample code and developer commentary.

Again you are free to use, modify and share these scripts BUT ONLY IF YOU GIVE ME CREDIT AND MAKE IT CLEARLY WITHIN YOUR PRODUCT/GAME
